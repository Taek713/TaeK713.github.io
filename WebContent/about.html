	<p>My name is Tae Kim and I am 21 years old and I have a few hobbies/activities that just
	 keeps me busy or something that gives me something to do. Watching sports is also a great "hobby", pretty much any sport but baseball. 
	 Some of these things include being a busy turtle owner, as you know they are really a handful, but awesome pets to have if you like mini Dinosaurs,
		being a side artist, taking photos on my 1976 Asahi Pentax K1000, reviewing music and being a movie junkie.
		Also, I love going to New York yearly and have been for the past 3 1/2
		years. I've been a resident of Detroit, mainly Southwest Detroit all my life and moved to Commerce Township in 2014. </p>
